# Focus Mode

This extension simplifies the styling of the Chrome extension and Web store documentation pages so that they are easier to read.

It shows an example of doing the following:

   - Use the extension service worker as the event coordinator.
   - Preserve user privacy through the activeTab permission.
   - Run code when the user clicks the extension toolbar icon.
   - Insert and remove a stylesheet using the Scripting API.
   - Use a keyboard shortcut to execute code.

   - Test the extension on a documentation page

First, open any of the following pages and click on the extension action or use keyboard shortcut by pressing Ctrl + B or Cmd + B:
